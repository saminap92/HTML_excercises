            <dd>
                    I have started my career as a coding instructor and moved to software development. I have worked on the complete SDLC starting from requirements analysis, creating design documents, coding, testing, implementation and user training. Currently I am upgrading my skillset by taking various online courses. I am also involved in the training department of Women In Big Data. I enjoy taking complex technical information, and trying to find ways to present them in ways that are fun, visual and easy to understand.
